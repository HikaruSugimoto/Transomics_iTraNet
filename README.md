# iTraNet: a Web-based Platform for integrated Trans-omics Network Visualization and Analysis

iTraNet is an interactive web application that visualizes and analyzes trans-omics networks involving four major types of networks: gene regulatory networks (including transcription factor, microRNA, and mRNA); protein-protein interactions; metabolic networks (including enzyme, mRNA, and metabolite); and metabolite exchange networks (including transporter, mRNA, and metabolite).

[`iTraNet`](https://itranet.streamlit.app/) is hosted on the Streamlit cloud.
The web application is provided using the Streamlit cloud's free plan, which might lead to slower access and computations. For faster and more stable calculations, users can download the code from this GitHub repository and run iTraNet on a local machine.
Use the commend below to launch the web application on a local machine.
    
    streamlit run main.py
