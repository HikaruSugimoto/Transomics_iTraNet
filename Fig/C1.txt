Differentially regulated metabolic reactions and associated differentially expressed molecules. Metabolic reactions are assumed to be catalyzed by metabolic enzymes and affected by metabolites that function as the substrates, products, or allosteric regulator. Regulation of metabolic reactions also consists of regulations by changing the amount of enzyme through gene expression. This inference draws from an analysis of data from KEGG API (https://www.kegg.jp/kegg/rest/) and BRENDA (https://www.brenda-enzymes.org/oldstart.php). The term “Total_number” represents the aggregate count of interconnections between the corresponding reaction and the linked molecules that exhibit differential expression patterns.
