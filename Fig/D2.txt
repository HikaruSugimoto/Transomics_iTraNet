The trans-omics network for differentially regulated transporter. Nodes and edges indicate differentially expressed molecules and differential regulations, respectively. The Transporter mRNA and Metabolite (Organ and Blood) layers correspond to differentially expressed transcripts and differentially expressed metabolites, respectively. The Transporter layer represents transporters associated with differentially expressed molecules. I, the number of increased molecules; D, the number of decreased molecules. The differential regulations are classified into either activating (edges with “increased color”) or inhibiting (edges with “decreased color”). Increased transporter mRNAs and increased metabolites are assumed to activate the reactions. The interactive network is depicted in the panel below.
