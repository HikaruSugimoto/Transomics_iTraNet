The trans-omics networks for differentially regulated metabolic reactions in each pathway. Nodes and edges indicate differentially expressed molecules and differentially regulated reactions, respectively. The differential regulations are classified into either activating (edges with “increased color”) or inhibiting (edges with “decreased color”). Increased Enzyme mRNA, increased Substrate, decreased Product, increased Allosteric AC, and decreased Allosteric IN are assumed to activate the reactions. Triangle with "increased color", increased molecule; Inverted triangle with "decreased color", decreased molecule; Diamond, Enzyme.
