Differentially regulated transporters and associated differentially expressed molecules. Transporters are assumed to be affected by the amount of metabolites and regulations by changing the amount of transporter gene expression. This inference draws from an analysis of data from The Transporter Classification Database (TCDB) (https://www.tcdb.org/). The term “Total_number” represents the aggregate count of interconnections between the corresponding transporter and the linked molecules that exhibit differential expression patterns.
