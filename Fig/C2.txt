The trans-omics network for differentially regulated metabolic reactions. Nodes and edges indicate differentially expressed molecules and differential regulated reactions, respectively. The Enzyme mRNA and Metabolite (Substrate, Product, Allosteric AC (activation), and Allosteric IN (inhibition)) layers correspond to differentially expressed genes and differentially expressed metabolites, respectively. The Reaction layer represents metabolic reactions regulated by differentially expressed molecules. I, the number of increased molecules; D, the number of decreased molecules. The Enzyme, Reaction, and Metabolite layers were mapped into global metabolic pathway using the KEGG database. The differential regulations are classified into either activating (edges with “increased color”) or inhibiting (edges with “decreased color”). Increased Enzyme mRNA, increased Substrate, decreased Product, increased Allosteric AC, and decreased Allosteric IN are assumed to activate the reactions. The interactive network is depicted in the panel below.
