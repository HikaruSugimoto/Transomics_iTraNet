"A, gene regulatory network (including TF, miRNA, and mRNA)" estimates transcription factors (TF) and miRNAs associated with the uploaded transcriptome data (organ or cell). The associated TF and miRNA are estimated using the ChIP-Atlas (https://chip-atlas.org/enrichment_analysis) and miRTarBase (https://mirtarbase.cuhk.edu.cn/~miRTarBase/miRTarBase_2022/php/download.php) databases, respectively.
