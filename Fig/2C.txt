“C, metabolic network (including enzyme, mRNA, and metabolite)” estimates metabolic reactions and enzymes associated with the uploaded transcriptome (organ or cell) and metabolome data (organ or cell). Metabolic reactions are assumed to be catalyzed by metabolic enzymes and affected by metabolites that function as the substrates, products, or allosteric regulators. Regulation of metabolic reactions also consists of regulations by changing the amount of enzyme through gene expression. This inference draws from analysis of data from KEGG (https://www.kegg.jp/kegg/rest/) and BRENDA (https://www.brenda-enzymes.org/oldstart.php).
